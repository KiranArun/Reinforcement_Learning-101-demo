# Reinforcement Learning 101

This is a self-contained laboratory session, of a Reinforcment Learning model (A3C) playing [Atari Space Invaders](https://gym.openai.com/envs/SpaceInvaders-v0/).

These Python based notebooks are designed to work inside Google's free research and education tool [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com),  which requires only a Google account. Check out their [FAQ](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html).

The human interface to the underlying [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) machine learning framework is the [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) environment, (which opens `*.ipynb` files).

#### Documented Notebooks:
1. A3C_workshop_part1.ipynb will load a model from a checkpoint, then run and display a game being played
    - the documentation will teach the NN structure and RL basics (eg. environments, agents, rewards)
    
2. A3C_workshop_part2.ipynb will train a model, saving checkpoints and logging to tensorboard
    - the documentation will teach how updating the model works and more about RL
   
### Instructions for running:

**1. Download or clone the repository**

  - if you downloaded the ZIP, extract it on your local machine and rename the folder to the name of this repo

**2. Go to google drive, and upload this folder from your local machine**

**3. From Drive, open a notebook file with Colaboratory**

  - Double-click some `*.ipynb` file, then choose _Connected Apps - Colaboratory_

  - If Colaboratory is not shown, you'll have to first add it from _Open With_, then search _Colab_, then connect. Choose https://colab.research.google.com

**4. From Colab, select runtime, change runtime type, and set hardware accelerator to GPU**

  - If it won't allocate one, that's fine (it'll just be a bit slower)
  
  - if you are using the GPU, it may well run out of GPU memory, so you'll have to change back to CPU

**5. if you dont have any model checkpoints, you will have to run A3C_workshop_part2.ipynb first**

  - colab isn't optimal to train as the vm stops at 12 hours
  
  - it's also hard to get the checkpoints off into your local machine or drive
  
  - if you're are taking part in my workshop, I will provide checkpoints from a training session that I did locally

### Contributions

Contributions are welcome, I particularly appreciate corrections from PR's or raised through _Issues_. Please make an individual PR for each suggestion.

Stack Overflow would be the best place for help with using the frameworks.
